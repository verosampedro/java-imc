# IMC exercise (starting with Java)

## What was the exercise about?

You want to develop a program that calculates the body mass index of a person. To do this, you need to define the person's weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). The body mass index (BMI) is calculated using the following formula:

BMI = weight / height2

Then, from the BMI obtained it is possible to calculate whether a person is normal, underweight, overweight or obese. To generate these results the calculated BMI must be in the ranges of the table.

Requirements:
- An output per terminal must be generated from the "App" class.


## Organization

We collect the person's data in a class, where the person's weight and height will be.

Then, we create a calculator class where the formula will be executed with the data contained in the person class. 

In addition, we will create a table about the state of the person, collecting there all the possible results that could come out and what they would mean (obesity, thinness).

Then, through the app we will run the scanner that will ask us to enter our weight in kilograms, height in meters and automatically calculate the BMI and print the result on the console.
